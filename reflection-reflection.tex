\section{Introduction}

Last year, over 100 billion emails were sent every day, according to the Email Statistics Report. A very common use case of sending emails in a work environment is to set up appointments for in-person or virtual meetings. However, several email exchanges are required in order to find a suitable time and place where all parties are available, and this back-and-forth calendar conflict resolution wastes 17 minutes per meeting on average, according to X.AI's Dennis Mortensen. This can add up to a significant waste of time (over 100 hours per year), which can be otherwise used for productive work.

For some professionals, scheduling these meetings manually can feel like a ``frustrating distraction from the things that matter" \cite{cranshaw_calendar.help:_2017} so much so that they hire assistants to help with the task. However, not everyone can afford full-time assistants and will therefore turn to software solutions. Intelligent virtual assistants over email built using machine learning can help by automating these scheduling messages. An AI assistant can access a user's calendar and can find empty meeting slots based on the location of the user location and their scheduling preferences, and then send and respond to emails on their behalf.

In this graduation project, I aim to design and develop an AI-powered intelligent virtual assistant that automates the email scheduling process. Professionals will be able to use the web interface of the assistant service to solve the ``time waste" problem when it comes to appointment scheduling. In the future, the capabilities of the assistant can be extended to essentially everything a human assistant can do, from sending outbound marketing emails and following up with coworkers on tasks, to automating other parts of the professional's life.

Of course, the product also has several ethical implications and possible social disruptions, such as job loss for secretaries by encouraging automation and ensuring data and privacy protection, apart from answering the main ethical conundrum â€” whether end users who receive emails from the service are informed that the email is written by an AI assistant, not a real human.

\section{Ethical Toolkit}

The Ethical Toolkit published by Santa Clara University's Markkula Center of Applied Ethics is used as a framework for ethical analysis in this section. Although an opinionated implementation, the core principles underlying this framework are essentially universal. For example, the ACTWith Model is an information processing model of moral cognition as cognitive agency and its 2-by-2 matrix of open and closed can offer a similar framework that highlights the same important focus areas \cite{white_understanding_2010}. The core idea is to gain empathy towards stackholders and foster a positive feedback loop.

The Toolkit is also very useful during the product development phase, as showcased in the Design and Development stages of the following integration flowchart. The Toolkit is not only useful for ethical analysis, but laying the toolkit on top of the product development cycle shows my workflow which aims to combine the product development lifecycle with this Toolkit.

\subsection{Ethical Risk Sweeping}

The first tool, ethical ``risk-sweeping", focuses on seeking to understand the moral risks that can be created or exacerbated by the choices in building and deploying this thesis project. Learning from history, there have been countless times when failure to identify such risks has resulted in real harm.

In this case, there can be ethical risks that arise, such as:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Authorship: Should recipients be made aware that the email is sent by an automated agent, not a human assistant?
 \item Job Loss: Using digital agents that can perform a human assistant's job more accurately, faster, and more inexpensively will lead to job loss
 \item Gender Bias: Assistant names like Alexa and Siri reenforce and spread gender bias and imply that only women should do such roles
 \item Technical Risks: Since personal information, including addresses and phone numbers, may be stored by users, data protection must be taken very seriously, and bank-grade security measures must be implemented
\end{enumerate}

These themes are discussed in detail in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Authorship: ``Sent by an AI"}

There are also several ethical questions that arise about whether recipients should know that an email was sent to them by a virtual agent, not a person. This section discusses the importance of authorship in ethical interaction design, and how the product in this thesis tackles those challenges.

\paragraph{Automated Journalism}


If you read major American newspapers such as \emph{Forbes} or the \emph{Los Angeles Times}, chances are you've already read a story entirely written by an AI-powered software system. This process is known as automated journalism, and highlights an important question about authorship: \emph{Who is the author of an article written by a virtual agent?} A 2005 study found that research participants attribute story credit to the programmers who developed the AI or the news organization publishing the story \cite{montal_i_2017}.

However, this is not the full picture. Since machine learning models require large amounts of training data that the agent ``learns" from (and, in some cases depending on the implementation, the output is largely inspired by the training data), the human authors of said data are also worthy contenders for the credit.

As another example, \emph{Summly}, a London-based startup founded in 2011 was acquired by \emph{Yahoo!} for \$30 million in 2013. At the name suggests, \emph{Summly} specialized in summarizing news sources using AI-powered software. Using ``thousands of sources", users could read algorithmically-generated summaries of news stories using their app. If a human was summarizing a news story, say from 20 paragraphs to 2 paragraphs, we wouldn't give them credit over the new story. In this case, the AI is essentially just a summarizing tool, except that it uses multiple, sometimes hundreds, of difference sources for each story. I would argue that the published summary should still be credited to the hundreds of authors of the data the AI used to generated summaries.

\paragraph{Crowdsourced Authorship}

Google's \emph{reCATCHA} is a popular challenge-response test for websites based on CAPTCHA (completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart), and is used by millions of websites because it's a simple and effective way to prevent spam or DDoS attacks \cite{poongodi_intrusion_2019}. Unbeknownst to most users, one of the two words entered by users was used to transcribe old books in the public domain \cite{january_2018_captcha_nodate}. Once all books in Google's collection were accurately transcribed by the public, the focus was shifted to transcribing text in photos from Google Street View in 2012. By 2014, almost all challenges were used to train Google's AI for use cases such as better Google Image Search results, more accurate Google Maps navigation, and object detection in Google Photos \cite{noauthor_im_nodate}.

Although Section 3(d) of \emph{reCAPTCHA}'s Terms of Service ensure that users allow ``sending that data to Google for analysis", a similar argument to automated journal can be presented: Should end users, i.e., the public, receive partial credit for the thousands of human hours that have been spent on training Google's AI? Furthermore, should people be compensated? From a legal standpoint, Google has their tracks covered, but this does showcase the ethical dilemma of virtual agents generating content and what happens when there is no clear authorship.

\paragraph{Authorship and Credibility}

The website \emph{ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com} shows you a headshot of an AI-generated person using a generative adversarial network (GAN). To my eyes, this is completely indistinguishable from the profile picture of an actual person. That particular GAN, called StyleGAN, was written by Nvidia and published in \emph{arXiv} \cite{karras_style-based_2019}. Although this is a proof of concept, it opens the door to applications like realistic 3D modeling. On the flip side, AI-generated content can be harmful too. ``While that is exciting, others may fear for the more sinister uses for the technology such as contributing to DeepFakes, computer-generated images superimposed on existing pictures or videos, that can be used to push fake news" \cite{noauthor_this_2019-1}.

So, why is authorship important? In one word, credibility. If you know the name of the author of an article in a major newspaper or magazine, you can find out more information about them, perhaps by visiting their social media handles. If you have any questions about their work, or found a mistake in their article, you can contact them directly. In the case of an article written by an unnamed virtual agent, the only option is to find the contact information of the publication.

It may be hard to answer the authorship question, but people are almost certain that the quality of articles generated by an AI do not match that of a trained journalist. In a 2020 paper published by Spain-based \emph{University of Castillaâ€“La Mancha}, a large sample size of participants (N=465) of media personnel, professors, students, and journalists concluded that was that the ``quality of automated news presents some important shortcomings" \cite{calvo-rubio_percepcion_2019}. They did, however, highlight the ``need to bet on a solid training of journalists that integrates the use of emerging technologies".

\paragraph{Authorship Clarity}

In news articles written by virtual agents, there is ``no visible indicator for readers to verify whether an article was written by a robot or human", which raises issues of transparency \cite{dorr_ethical_2017}. Both \emph{Summly} and related software claim the created work as their own, or strongly imply it by not citing individual source authors.

In the case of EIVA, if an AI assistant is impersonating a human assistant to send emails on the professional's behalf, it raises the same ethical question of whether the end user receiving the email should know that it was not written by a human. In my personal opinion, I am completely fine with deceiving recipients on such a trivial authorship question, but I understand that this sets a powerful and potentially harmful precedent for AI authorship.

This is why the ethical toolkit (see Section 3) recommends complete customizability and ownership from the user. Using the EIVA website's settings page, consumers can set preferences about whether they want their assistant to inform end users about the fact that they are virtual agents, not human assistants. By default, this is preselected for all users (see Section 3.1), and is a simple checkbox user interface with the message ``Inform recipients that your assistant is a virtual assistant". This clarity highlights the commitment to personalization that such a product should bring.

\begin{figure}[h]

 \caption{Checkbox user interface}
 \label{fig:checkbox}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Job Loss}

Just like in other applications of automation software, loss of employment for assistants is an important social disruption that this product unfortunately encourages. In the interest of saving both time and money, companies may choose to deploy AI-powered assistants on an organization-wide level and terminate the employment of all their secretaries in the future.

In a survey of administrative assistants, all but one reported that most of their work was scheduling-related \cite{erickson_assistance:_2008}. Though in the current state, EIVA only focuses on appointment scheduling, this is expected to change in the future as more features are added. Slowly, software agents like EIVA will be able to do more and more of the day-to-day job of an assistant, and will prove to be both faster and more inexpensive.

EIVA cannot currently perform more actions like writing emails from scratch (it uses fixed templates), and even if automated agents do, creative work is much harder to automate, though definitely not impossible. This might suspect that other professions, like the journalists discussed in the previous section, are safe. In that same 2020 paper from Spain, the group of journalists and academics inconclusively debated whether or not technology will not have a negative impact on the journalistic labor market, but agreed that journalists should be trained to use modern technologies such as this.

\paragraph{Mass Unemployment}

Taking a more big picture perspective, ``widespread job loss" is considered an effect of smart software bots such as EIVA entering the workforce. According to \emph{McKinsey}, ``depending upon various adoption scenarios, automation will displace between 400 and 800 million jobs by 2030, requiring as many as 375 million people to switch job categories entirely" \cite{noauthor_impact_2020}.

From a purely ethics perspective, it may be argued that we should do everything we can to prevent mass unemployment, since it leads to several effects on the physical and mental health of people. A study from the US National Library of Medicine concluded that `symptoms of somatization, depression, and anxiety were significantly greater in the unemployed than employed`" \cite{linn_effects_1985}. However, I firmly believe that this is not an optional evolutionary step that can be delayed; it's a fundamental shift that market forces will determine, regardless of whether it unemploys large sections of the population.

\emph{CGP Grey}'s short film \emph{Humans Need Not Apply} goes a step further and defines the analogy between humans and horses as follows: just like ``mechanical muscles" such as automobiles replaced horses, ``mechanical minds" like software bots (much like EIVA) will replace humans. He formulates that just like horses may have argued that previous technological advancements only made their job easier (like horse wagons), humans currently argue that AI in the workplace will help humans transition to more creative work \cite{noauthor_youtube_nodate}. However, this argument does not work because a ``poetry-driven economy" cannot sustain; creative work has a popularity effect, which is why only a small percent of the population can sustain with such jobs. The question policymakers have to answer is: \emph{What are we going to do when we have significant portions of the population unemployed, through no fault of their own?} Perhaps we have to look at answers such as promoting tourism, investing in retraining, exploring financial solutions such as Universal Basic Income, and so on.

\paragraph{Human Assistants}

For the purposes of this thesis project, there is a strong conclusion that as EIVAs become smarter and market adoption increases, there definitely will be a cause-effect relationship with human assistant unemployment. I'd further say that someone who has used an EVA (and perhaps paid around \$10 per month for it) will not ever want to go back to a human assistant that is slower, makes more mistakes, and costs over 100x more.

Personally, I built a prototype version of EIVA (then called \emph{Ara}) and used it for several months to confirm appointments. In fact, in a 2017 interview titled ``UT student among the top 50 young entrepreneurs" about my listing in the Dutch business newspaper \emph{Het Financieele Dagblad}'s annual list of the 50 most-innovative entrepreneurs and professionals in the Netherlands with \emph{UToday}, \emph{University of Twente}'s independent publication, Jelle Posthuma stated the following in the beginning of the article \cite{noauthor_ut_nodate}:

\begin{displayquote}
It was easy to schedule an interview with the first-year student of Creative Technology. His ``personal assistant" Ara sent a friendly email replying: ``Youâ€™ll be welcome to come next Wednesday." Chowdhary is a co-owner of the company Oswald Labs, which develops products for people with disabilities. His office is in Roombeek. ``Anand, youâ€™re working hard: you even have a personal assistantâ€¦" A big grin appears on the young studentâ€™s face. ``Yes, I built her myself. Ara is a computer. Her AI recognizes emails and schedules my appointments."
\end{displayquote}

Since I have already used a preliminary version of EIVA and it's clear how much useful it is, and how much impact it has on recipients, I am certain that I would not want to go back to a human assistant for scheduling. Though this is validation for the product, it is also a small proof for the power of automated agents doing human jobs. Therefore, the ethical implications of job loss due to AI is a large consideration when building such tools. Though currently in its infancy, the software bot industry is very harmful to the status quo, especially in terms of general population employment.

\subsection{Ethical Pre- and Post-mortems}

Like the first step focuses on individual risks, the second step is about avoiding systemic ethical failures. This is very important because, as discussed above, historical precedent suggests that cascade effect is common; multiple failures together add up to catastrophic ethical problems, although any one of them individually would not be significant cause for concern.

The idea behind a pre-mortem is to exercise moral imagination to analyze potential ethical disasters without waiting for them to occur.

The first question to be answered in \emph{How could EIVA fail for ethical reasons?} To answer this, we must take a closer look at some of the underlying principles, like protection of personal data. Similarly, \emph{What systems can we put in place to reduce failure risk?} can be answered with the perspective of protecting sensitive information using standards like encryption. The issue of privacy is further discussed in the following sections.

\subsection{Expanding the Ethical Circle}

As discussed in the previous section, the scope of harm has not been well-understood previously, during the ethical and product development stage. This is in part because of the fact that designers and engineers may ignore the interests of certain stakeholders, or at least don't consider them sufficiently.

According to Vallor, Shannon, Green, and Raicu, ``To mitigate these common errors, design teams need a tool that requires them to â€˜expand the ethical circleâ€™ and invite stakeholder input and perspectives beyond their own."

\subsubsection{Identifying Key Stakeholders}

The basic stakeholders are the users who will interact with EIVA -- the consumers of the assistant service, and the recipients of emails sent by the assistant. However, both these highly interested people have largely different powers; one controls the behavior of the assistant and the other merely interacts with it.

Therefore, although it's important to consider the inputs of each stakeholder, it can be useful to prioritize stakeholders based on how much interest then have in the product, and how much power they have over the designers and engineering building the product. The Power-Interest Grid (Figure 3) can be a useful tool to prioritize your tasks based on four categories \cite{noauthor_stakeholder_nodate}.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{High power, highly interested people} (Manage Closely): we must fully engage these people, and make the greatest efforts to satisfy them:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Users who are using EIVA and have their own assistant that schedules appointments
    \item External client who is funding and invested in this research project
  \end{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{High power, less interested people} (Keep Satisfied): put enough work in with these people to keep them satisfied, but not so much that they become bored with your message
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Companies who might not directly care about EIVA, but the difference in employable assistants when compared to EIVA
  \end{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Low power, highly interested people} (Keep Informed): adequately inform these people, and talk to them to ensure that no major issues are arising. People in this category can often be very helpful with the detail of your project
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Users who are recipients in emails sent by EIVA; they don't have the power to control or customize the assistant, but are directly communicating with it
    \item Human personal assistants whose employment may feel threatened
    \item People who have signed up to start using the EIVA service on launch
  \end{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Low power, less interested people} (Monitor): again, monitor these people, but donâ€™t bore them with excessive communication
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item People who have participated in the research and are unsure whether they would want to use the service in the future
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{power-interest.jpg}
 \caption{Power-Interest Grid}
 \label{fig:checkbox}
\end{figure}

These groups of stakeholders can also be divided based on the factor they are interested in and impacted by \cite{mendelow_environmental_1981}. The table below highlights these key stakeholder groups and their impact interest areas:

\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c| }

  & \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{\textbf{Impact Interest Areas}} \\
  \hline
  \textbf{Stakeholder Group} & \rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{\textbf{ Job Loss }} & \rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{\textbf{ EIVA Sales }} & \rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{\textbf{ EIVA Features }} & \rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{\textbf{ EIVA Reliability }} \\
  \hline
  Consumers using EIVA & & & \checkmark & \checkmark \\

  Human assistants & \checkmark & & \checkmark & \\
  \hline
  Companies & \checkmark & & & \checkmark \\
  \hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Case-based Analysis}

EIVA is perhaps best-described as a combination of several creative and powerful solutions for scheduling from the past -- sending emails, calendar invitations, and AI assistants. As such, it also inherits the ethical risk and lessons from these products.

\subsubsection{Privacy}

The privacy precedent that most virtual assistants have set is not highly positive. Personal assistants in the form of smart speakers like Amazon Echo (running Alexa) and Google Home (running Assistant) have ``begun to significantly alter peopleâ€™s everyday experiences with technology" \cite{pridmore_personal_2020}. These virtual assistants can continually improve with increased usage using deep learning \cite{kepuska_next-generation_2018}. Although this makes the assistants more useful over time, they also ``amplify the overall debate about privacy issues" \cite{zeng_end_2017}.

\paragraph{Amazon Echo}

For example, an Echo device unintentionally recorded a Portland family's private conversations and shared it with a random person from their contact list \cite{noauthor_this_nodate}. A prime example of postmortems is Amazon's response, ``We investigated what happened and determined this was an extremely rare occurrence. We are taking steps to avoid this from happening in the future," which suggests that this may have been prevented if the device was tested better.

For EIVA, the learning is simple: make sure no personal information is recorded if it is not strictly necessary, and users should be able to configure what they want to share. All privacy-compromizing applications, regardless of how important they may be, should be opt-in, not opt-out.

\subsubsection{Gender Bias}

There is often visible gender bias when it comes to personal assistants or secretaries \cite{noauthor_why_2018}. According to \emph{CNN}, the rise of the secretary began with the increased paperwork during the the Industrial Revolution, ``the job became popular in the 1950s, when 1.7 million women were â€˜stenographers, typists or secretaries" \cite{noauthor_its_2013}. This sexist ``tradition" has become so widespread that there have been a large number of cases of executives requesting female blonde assistants. ``There is definitely a problem when an employer expects their new hire to look a certain way or assumes that everyone working in support is female. `No, I definitely wouldnâ€™t consider a male PA' -- that comment is ubiquitous" \cite{williams_secretaries_2016}.

Historically, these were executive assistants, but modern technologies have translated them to virtual assistants as well. When asked about why Cortana is female, a \emph{Microsoft} spokesperson said Cortana can technically be genderless, but the company did immerse itself in gender research when choosing a voice and weighed the benefits of a male and female voice \cite{pcmag_real_2018}, ``for our objectives â€” building a helpful, supportive, trustworthy assistant â€” a female voice was the stronger choice".

Apple's Siri and Google Assistant offer the option of changing the voice to male, but Alexa and Cortana don't have male counterparts. The first United Nations' examination of gendering of AI technology found that ``gender imbalances in the digital sector can be `hard-coded' into technology products" \cite{noauthor_id_nodate}. In that report, the following problems are highlighted:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Digital assistants reflect, reinforce and spread gender bias
  \item They model acceptance and tolerance of sexual harassment and verbal abuse
  \item They send explicit and implicit messages about how women and girls should respond to requests and express themselves
  \item They make women the â€˜faceâ€™ of glitches and errors that result from the limitations of hardware and software designed predominately by men
  \item They force synthetic â€˜femaleâ€™ voices and personality to defer questions and commands to higher (and often male) authorities
\end{itemize}

The outdated argument that ``this has always been the way things are" was the same when defending unacceptable historic precedents like slavery. It is unfortunate that this sexist default has slipped into digital assistants as well, but it is not very hard to explore how this can be fixed. The UN report makes 15 recommendations, including ``[ending] the practice of making digital assistants female by default."

For EIVA, this is an important lesson because I've personally made this mistake before. With the intention of sounding friendly, the original name for EIVA was \emph{Ara}, chosen because it was short and memorable. However, the gender role that accompanies this is a big problem, therefore the name was changed to EIVA, which is an acronym for Email-based Intelligent Virtual Assistant, and yet sounds friendly and human-like. However, though the name of the service is EIVA, there is no reason why users cannot select their own names for their assistant.

Unisex names like \emph{Alex} and \emph{Jesse} can be used by end users; the idea is to make the assistant completely customizable. To make this easy, the first setting in the user interface is to select the assistant's name and signature, which users can freely pick.


\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

\subsection{Ethical Benefits of Creative Work}

The previous sections have been focused on discovering ethical errors and trying to mediate them, but ethical design is not limited to identifying risks, it's about leading to a positive outcome. In the case of EIVA, saving time in itself is a major help for most people; if you have several meeting every week, you can save almost 100 hours a year by switching to EIVA.

Therefore, a workflow must be established to formalize the process of understanding the ethical benefits of this product. The first question to answer is \emph{Why are we doing this, and for what good ends?} In this case, work-life balance is an important factor, and that saved time---although just 15 minutes per meeting---adds up to being more productive at work, and having saved time that can be better used at home or the gym. This is kept in mind during the prototyping and development phase, to make sure people have all the options to customize and personalize the assistant based on their preferences and to maximize time saved.

The next, and perhaps most important, question is \emph{Will our customers truly be better off with an EIVA than without it? Are we trying to generate inauthentic needs or manufactured desires, simply to justify a new thing to sell?} The answer to the second question is clear: people spend a lot of valuable time in scheduling appointments. As discussed in Section 2.1.2, in a survey of administrative assistants, all but one reported that most of their work was scheduling-related \cite{erickson_assistance:_2008}. This strongly suggests that a non-trivial amount of human hours are spent on scheduling, and customers would definitely be better off saving that time. Ideally, an EIVA will not replace the human assistant, but help them do their job better and faster.

Other important questions to keep in mind are \emph{Has the ethical benefit of this technology remained at the center of our work and thinking?} and \emph{What are we willing to sacrifice to do this right?} and these require a continuous evaluation of the ethical values embedded in the product. Though the ethical benefit has been motivated by the financial benefit of saving billable time, and therefore money, and perhaps selling EIVA as a service that does justice to the unit economics of time saved, this does not mean that the ethical benefit is lost.

Furthermore, as discussed in the following section, a significant amount of thought has been given to taking security precautions such as implementing bank-grade measures to keep sensitive information safe. Values such as these have been a core part of the product, as witnessed by initial testers. Although there have only been 6 people who have tested EIVA so far (the research is still in an early testing stage), the average response to question \emph{How would you rate the privacy features available in the app?} has been 4.85 out of 5 \cite{chowdhary_anandchowdhary/thesis_2020}. This is arguably a higher degree of privacy and security that you would get if you manage appointments using a human assistant.

\subsection{Think About the Terrible People}

Although positive thinking can be a powerful tool to explore the ideal scenarios for a product, ``sometimes what can be a virtue becomes a vice", and in reality, there will always be those who try and use technology for exploitation or unfair personal gain.

\subsubsection{Explorations}

\emph{Who will want to abuse, steal, misinterpret, hack, destroy, or weaponize what we built?} Since the EIVA has access to personal information such as calendar URLs and meeting locations (addresses, email IDs, IM usernames, etc.) of the user, people may be incentivized to sell this information.

\emph{Who will use it with alarming stupidity/irrationality?} People who are not very technically literate and sign up for the service may confuse the intention, and make their personal information available to the public, for example by adding their home address as a location the assistant can recommend for incoming meeting requests.

\emph{What rewards/incentives/openings has our design inadvertently created for those people?}

\emph{How can we \emph{remove} those rewards/incentives?} Implementing strict security protocols can help make sure unauthorized people don't gain access to personal information. The following section discusses some of the measures taking in building and testing the application presented in this paper.

\subsubsection{Implementations}

In terms of building the webapp and backend APIs, steps have been taken to ensure  highest standards of security. For example, all communication between the frontend app and backend are encrypted with 256-bit TLS/SSL. All requests made using the insecure HTTP protocol are automatically redirected to the secure HTTPS standard. Furthermore, all collected logs for data analytics are encrypted with the industry-standard AES-256, the same security used by banks to protect your information.

Other common methods of exploitation, such as port scanning, are prevented by only opening up the required ports. In this case, only ports 80/443 (for web traffic), 22 (for SSH), and 19999 (for NetData) are open. All other ports are closed to any incoming traffic by default. Steps are also taken to prevent DDoS attacks like installing Cloudflare's DDoS Protection that shows mandatory CAPTCHA challenges to bad apples.

For API protection, strict rate limiting has been implemented. Web APIs use rate limits to ``prevent unauthorized users to compute service levels with an high confidence while still allowing the creation of useful value-added services" \cite{firmani_computing_2019}. A rate limit of 1,000 requests per minute for authenticated requests, and 60 requests per minute for unauthenticated requests is enforced.

For authorization, the industry-standard access/refresh token methodology is used, with an access token and refresh token expiry duration of 15 minutes and 30 days respectively. This means that if someone gets access to a user's access token (which is interchangeable with the session ID in legacy systems), that token will automatically be invalidated after 15 minutes. Furthermore, even if they get access to the refresh token, users have the option to remotely logout and disable sessions from the web app interface.

To store sensitive information such as passwords, a one-way, undecryptable cryptographically secure hash function is used, \emph{bcrypt}. This means that even if someone gains access to the database through a breach in security, passwords are not stored in plain text and therefore useless to them.

Overall, since users may have personal information available to the virtual assistant, many industry-standard security compliance steps have been taken in the development and testing of the product.

\subsection{Ethical Feedback and Iteration}

Technological ethics is an ongoing process, and does not stop when the product is launched or in the hands of consumers. Furthermore, as more and more intelligent systems like EIVA continue to shape society, the ethical impact is always going to be a moving target.

For gathering feedback from stakeholders, several measures are taken. For example, users can log in to the webapp and access the feedback form by clicking on the `Help' icon on the bottom-right corner of each page. This ensures that the system is set up for encouraging feedback and to identify where the feedback is coming from.

\subsubsection{Continuous Integration (CI)}

From a technical perspective, unit tests, end-to-end test, and a CI process has been set up to ensure that no bad code gets deployed to users. Whenever a new commit is pushed to the central repository, the code is only deployed to the production app when there is a successful build \cite{noauthor_what_2019}. When there is an error in the build (for example, if a test fails), the developers get a notification for mitigation.

Furthermore, error tracking has been enabled using Sentry. Using Sentry, developers can get notifications, including specific lines of code, when an error is throws, and users can be prompted for feedback \cite{anser_sentry.io_2017}. Therefore, even if there is an error in the webapp while a user is using it, the Sentry feedback loop ensures that swift code-fixing action is taken.

\subsubsection{Sensible Defaults}

Using the feedback from users, especially for customizable options related to individual privacy, the less secure (more open) options should always be opt-in, not opt-out. Based on the results of the initial survey with users and feedback from stakeholders, combined with the empathic design approach of trying to understand user interest by stepping into their shoes, ensures that we set sensible default.

It has been estimated that 95\% of all users stick to the default settings in an application, and don't bother to change them \cite{catalanotto_95_2019}. This is an important responsibility on the hands of designers and engineers to ensure that the default options are most secure. In EIVA, options such as email tracking, directly connecting a calendar, etc., are all optional and opt-in, so the default state is always most secure.

For other features like setting the default email language, error emails, etc., are also based on results of the survey and therefore directly a result of the feedback loop. Instead of selecting opinionated defaults, this empathetic approach helps keep users safe most of the time, while adding to the product's utility.

\subsubsection{Feedback Loop}

The core principle in this Toolkit, the same as in the ACTWith Model, is the positive feedback loop that ensures new information takes us back to the drawing board. The particular implementation of this model was explored earlier (see Figure 1), and this feedback loop has been tightly integration in the product development process.
