	abstract = {Due to the dynamic in nature, the vulnerabilities that exist in VANET are much higher when compared with that of the wired network infrastructure. In DoS attacks, the legitimate users are prohibited from accessing the services or network resource. The primary goal of the attack to make the desired destination vehicle unavailable or relegate the message all the way through the network affects the reachability. The proposed reCAPTCHA controller mechanism prevents the automated attacks similarly like botnet zombies. The reCAPTCHA controller is used to check and prohibit most of the automated DDoS attacks. For implementing this technique, the information theory based metric is used to analyze the deviation in users request in terms of entropy. Frequency and entropy are the metrics used to measure the vulnerability of the attack. The stochastic model based reCAPTCHA controller is used as a prevention mechanism for the large botnet based attackers. To inspect the efficiency of the proposed method, various network parameters are considered such as Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Average Latency (AL), Detection Rate (DR) and Energy Consumption (EC). In the proposed research work, the metric PDR is used to know successful delivery of data packets to the destination vehicle without any interrruption. These parameters are used to measure how effectively the data is delivered to the destination from source vehicle.},

	abstract = {From a prospective study of the impact of stress on health in 300 men assessed every six months, men who became unemployed after entering the study were compared with an equal number, matched for age and race, who continued to work. Psychological and health data after unemployment were compared between the two groups by multivariate analysis of variance and covariance. After unemployment, symptoms of somatization, depression, and anxiety were significantly greater in the unemployed than employed. Large standard deviations on self-esteem scores in the unemployed group suggested that some men coped better than others with job-loss stress. Further analysis showed those with higher esteem had more support from family and friends than did those with low self-esteem. Furthermore, unemployed men made significantly more visits to their physicians, took more medications, and spent more days in bed sick than did employed individuals even though the number of diagnoses in the two groups were similar.},
