Researchers seem to have overlooked this conclusion, possibly because they have approached the problem as a purely manifest phenomenon without reference to a statistical model of the data-generating process. The study of such models and their application to empirical data also reveals that position bias (1) is not necessarily disclosed by rotation, (2) is often much more important than sampling error, and (3) precludes usual estimation of the parameters of the data-generating process. These findings also have implications for nonverbal stimuli and raise questions about efforts to handle position-biased experimental data when the response variable is only nominally scaled.},

	abstract = {Many authentication schemes depend on secret passwords. Unfortunately, the length and randomness of user-chosen passwords remain fixed over time. In contrast, hardware improvements constantly give attackers increasing computational power. As a result, password schemes such as the traditional UNIX user-authentication system are failing with time. This paper discusses ways of building systems in which password security keeps up with hardware speeds. We formalize the properties desirable in a good password system, and show that the computational cost of any secure password scheme must increase as hardware improves. We present two algorithms with adaptable cost--eksblowfish, a block cipher with a purposefully expensive key schedule, and bcrypt, a related hash function. Failing a major breakthrough in complexity theory, these algorithms should allow password-based systems to adapt to hardware improvements and remain secure well into the future.},

  abstract = {Due to the dynamic in nature, the vulnerabilities that exist in VANET are much higher when compared with that of the wired network infrastructure. In DoS attacks, the legitimate users are prohibited from accessing the services or network resource. The primary goal of the attack to make the desired destination vehicle unavailable or relegate the message all the way through the network affects the reachability. The proposed reCAPTCHA controller mechanism prevents the automated attacks similarly like botnet zombies. The reCAPTCHA controller is used to check and prohibit most of the automated DDoS attacks. For implementing this technique, the information theory based metric is used to analyze the deviation in users request in terms of entropy. Frequency and entropy are the metrics used to measure the vulnerability of the attack. The stochastic model based reCAPTCHA controller is used as a prevention mechanism for the large botnet based attackers. To inspect the efficiency of the proposed method, various network parameters are considered such as Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Average Latency (AL), Detection Rate (DR) and Energy Consumption (EC). In the proposed research work, the metric PDR is used to know successful delivery of data packets to the destination vehicle without any interrruption. These parameters are used to measure how effectively the data is delivered to the destination from source vehicle.},

Psychological and health data after unemployment were compared between the two groups by multivariate analysis of variance and covariance. After unemployment, symptoms of somatization, depression, and anxiety were significantly greater in the unemployed than employed. Large standard deviations on self-esteem scores in the unemployed group suggested that some men coped better than others with job-loss stress. Further analysis showed those with higher esteem had more support from family and friends than did those with low self-esteem. Furthermore, unemployed men made significantly more visits to their physicians, took more medications, and spent more days in bed sick than did employed individuals even though the number of diagnoses in the two groups were similar.},

  abstract = {Data-provisioning services can provide high value. Since data can be used and misused in unpredictable ways, organizations deal with the dilemma "to expose or not to expose" their data through Web APIs and - depending on the nature of their business - ponder possible opportunities and pitfalls. Rate limiting strategies are widely employed to control access to data and to safeguard back-end computational resources. However, their effectiveness depends on a good choice of the maximum allowed rate at which information can be "safely" released to users. A relevant scenario is represented by public administrations and private companies providing services whose quality is regulated by formal business agreements on the service levels. These organizations may need to choose a rate limit for their Web APIs that prevent unauthorized users to compute service levels with an high confidence while still allowing the creation of useful value-added services. In this paper, we propose a general statistical model for this problem and a technique, based on uniform sampling tools, to select an appropriate rate limit, and we demonstrate its validity through a case study involving a large bus company.},

  abstract = {One of the goals of Artificial intelligence (AI) is the realization of natural dialogue between humans and machines. in recent years, the dialogue systems, also known as interactive conversational systems are the fastest growing area in AI. Many companies have used the dialogue systems technology to establish various kinds of Virtual Personal Assistants(VPAs) based on their applications and areas, such as Microsoft's Cortana, Apple's Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Facebook's M. However, in this proposal, we have used the multi-modal dialogue systems which process two or more combined user input modes, such as speech, image, video, touch, manual gestures, gaze, and head and body movement in order to design the Next-Generation of VPAs model. The new model of VPAs will be used to increase the interaction between humans and the machines by using different technologies, such as gesture recognition, image/video recognition, speech recognition, the vast dialogue and conversational knowledge base, and the general knowledge base. Moreover, the new VPAs system can be used in other different areas of applications, including education assistance, medical assistance, robotics and vehicles, disabilities systems, home automation, and security access control.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things is becoming increasingly widespread in home environments. Consumers are transforming their homes into smart homes, with internet-connected sensors, lights, appliances, and locks, controlled by voice or other user-defined automations. Security experts have identi\_ed concerns with IoT and smart homes, including privacy risks as well as vulnerable and unreliable devices. These concerns are supported by recent high profile attacks, such as the Mirai DDoS attacks. However, little work has studied the security and privacy concerns of end users who actually set up and interact with today's smart homes. To bridge this gap, we conduct semi-structured interviews with fifteen people living in smart homes (twelve smart home administrators and three other residents) to learn about how they use their smart homes, and to understand their security and privacy related attitudes, expectations, and actions. Among other findings, we identify gaps in threat models arising from limited technical understanding of smart homes, awareness of some security issues but limited concern, ad hoc mitigation strategies, and a mismatch between the concerns and power of the smart home administrator and other people in the home. From these and other findings, we distill recommendations for smart home technology designers and future research.},

  abstract = {Recent developments, both in the cognitive sciences and in world events, bring special emphasis to the study of morality. The cognitive sciences, spanning neurology, psychology, and computational intelligence, offer substantial advances in understanding the origins and purposes of morality. Meanwhile, world events urge the timely synthesis of these insights with traditional accounts that can be easily assimilated and practically employed to augment moral judgment, both to solve current problems and to direct future action. The object of the following paper is to present such a synthesis in the form of a model of moral cognition, the ACTWith model of conscience. The purpose of the model is twofold. One, the ACTWith model is intended to shed light on personal moral dispositions, and to provide a tool for actual human moral agents in the refinement of their moral lives. As such, it relies on the power of personal introspection, bolstered by the careful study of moral exemplars available to all persons in all cultures in the form of literary or religious figures, if not in the form of contemporary peers and especially leadership. Two, the ACTWith model is intended as a minimum architecture for fully functional artificial morality. As such, it is essentially amodal, implementation non-specific and is developed in the form of an information processing control system. There are given as few hard points in this system as necessary for moral function, and these are themselves taken from review of actual human cognitive processes, thereby intentionally capturing as closely as possible what is expected of moral action and reaction by human beings. Only in satisfying these untutored intuitions should an artificial agent ever be properly regarded as moral, at least in the general population of existing moral agents. Thus, the ACTWith model is intended as a guide both for individual moral development and for the development of artificial moral agents as future technology permits.},

The new architecture leads to an automatically learned, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes (e.g., pose and identity when trained on human faces) and stochastic variation in the generated images (e.g., freckles, hair), and it enables intuitive, scale-specific control of the synthesis. The new generator improves the state-of-the-art in terms of traditional distribution quality metrics, leads to demonstrably better interpolation properties, and also better disentangles the latent factors of variation. To quantify interpolation quality and disentanglement, we propose two new, automated methods that are applicable to any generator architecture.
