## 👩‍💻 Development

Text is written in LaTeX in the [`thesis.tex`](./thesis.tex) file, and compiled to PDF using the available LaTeX distribution.

On GitHub Actions, [`xu-cheng/latex-action@v2`](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action) is used. The PDF is distributed as a [release](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/thesis/releases) and also hosted using GitHub Pages from the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/thesis/tree/gh-pages) branch.

Locally, [Texpad](https://www.texpad.com) is used for writing in and compiling LaTeX.
