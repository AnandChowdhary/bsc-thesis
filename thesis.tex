\section{Introduction}

Setting up appointments by email is a non-trivial waste of time. Last year, 110 billion consumer emails were sent per day, with a very common use case being setting up appointments \cite{noauthor_email_2019}. Several email exchanges are required in order to find a suitable time and place where all parties are available, and almost 1 in 5 users struggle with finding sufficient available time slots \cite{blaszkiewicz_research_2018}. This back-and-forth calendar conflict resolution wastes on average 17 minutes per meeting \cite{dennis_4_2017}. Moreover, over 3 in 5 meetings end up getting rescheduled for a different time or place \cite{dennis_how_2018}, which wastes additional time in confirmations. This adds up to about 9 hours wasted every month per person.

For some professionals, scheduling these meetings manually can feel like a ``frustrating distraction from the things that matter," so much so that they hire assistants to help with the task \cite{cranshaw_calendarhelp_2017}. However, not everyone can afford full-time assistants and will therefore turn to software solutions.

Email-based intelligent virtual assistants (EIVA \textipa{/i:vA/}) can help by automating these scheduling messages. An EIVA can access a user's calendar and find empty meeting slots based on their location and scheduling preferences. It can then send and respond to emails regarding scheduling meetings on the user's behalf, and the user can directly interact with the EIVA over email.

The goal of this paper is to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Build a functional virtual assistant with email integration, along with a companion web application to manage meetings and preferences; and
	\item Conduct a user evaluation on both the usability of the assistant over email and the user interface of the web application.
\end{enumerate}

Finally, as the external client is a communications technology company, the product should be built with best practices in mind, including using a modern stack of front-end and back-end programming languages and frameworks, with a focus on customizability, privacy, and security. Sensible defaults will be implemented based on user research and client feedback, and an ethical analysis will be conducted to answer questions of gender bias and AI-driven job loss.

\section{State of the Art}

\subsection{Scheduling}

\subsubsection{How professionals schedule appointments}

In their fundamental forms, calendars are the ``most basic of all human sensemaking devices" \cite{wajcman_digital_2019}. From time immemorial, calendars have been used as tools to establish patterns through which nearly all institutions, societies, and social groups manage orderliness. Notably, the first ``book" printed by Gutenberg in 1452 was a calendar \cite{editors_printing_nodate}, and today, professionals increasingly use digital calendars for the same purpose of time management and accountability. Digital calendars have become ``the standard office tool for coordinating and synchronizing work activities" \cite{wajcman_digital_2019}.

There are several calendaring software products available to professionals, both commercial and open source. In general, they offer a range of features, including calendar views, built-in address book, appointment reminders, and email integration \cite{noauthor_top_2019}. Many major internet companies offer such solutions, such as Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, Apple Calendar, and Mozilla Thunderbird. For company-wide adoption, enterprise software such as Microsoft Exchange and IBM Notes are also available \cite{masli_design_2011}. University of Twente, for example, recommends the use of Google Calendar \cite{noauthor_home_nodate}.

However, company-wide adoption of scheduling software is troublesome. For end users, it requires behavioral change, such as using a different tool than they are used to \cite{ehrlich_strategies_1987}. Additionally, there is no ``one size fits all" solution to calendaring, because there is a wide variation in people's meeting needs. For example, a professor who wants to schedule office hours with students might want students to pick their preferred meeting times, whereas a corporate executive might want to heavily control their availability times and response to meeting requests.

Professionals who can afford to hire assistants choose to delegate the hassle of scheduling. In a survey of administrative assistants, all but one reported that most of their work was scheduling-related, wasting hundreds of man-hours \cite{erickson_assistance_2008}.

\subsubsection{Shortfalls of calendaring tools}

Currently available products force the end user to manually enact the process of scheduling \cite{jennings_agent-based_1995}. For this reason, these tools avoid the need to actively reason about constraints and the user's scheduling preferences, such as which one of the many available meeting times to choose when underconstrained, and how the user would prefer to relax a meeting request when overconstrained \cite{berry_ptime_2011}. In a work environment, there are further decisions to make, such as which conference room is best for a given type of meeting, or setting up remote meetings using video calling software. All of these decisions are presently passed onto the end user.

These calendaring tools are also ``particularly cumbersome when attendees need to coordinate multiple schedules while each using their own individual tool and approach" \cite{cranshaw_calendarhelp_2017}. This is especially true for users who have multiple calendars, such as a different calendar for work and personal lives. A survey of 23 professionals found that substantially more than half of the respondents maintain more than one calendar, with some respondents using as high as six calendars at once \cite{kelley_how_1982}. Another survey reported that 2 calendars were used by professionals on average \cite{kincaid_electronic_1985}. Keeping separate work and private calendars is the norm ``even though the standard weekly interface of most scheduling software is meant to occlude such distinctions" \cite{wajcman_digital_2019}. This suggests that an important feature of the ideal scheduling software would be the ability to synchronize and find availability from multiple calendars.

Apart from calendaring tools, some users opt for scheduling tools that have additional features available, though they too possess shortcomings. For example, Google Calendar's ``Find a time" feature helps users select a time by displaying the availability of all participants graphically \cite{noauthor_google_2016}. This is particularly helpful when integrated on an institutional level, with features such as room booking and team invitations, but it also introduces new challenges for participants who do not add their agenda to their calendar well in advance. A 1982 survey found enormous differences in the time span coverage between respondents, with some users planning appointments months in advance while others concerned only with the current day and the day following \cite{kelley_how_1982}. Hence, scheduling software must be conversational and confirm the proposed time with guests without directly relying upon their calendar.

Although digital calendars have been the standard office tool for professionals, they are currently unable to bridge the communication gap between the end user and the invitees. Current scheduling products also lack a holistic solution to calendaring due to a wide variation in people's meeting needs. Thus, end users have to rely upon emailing to communicate meeting details effectively, wasting otherwise productive man-hours.

\subsubsection{Virtual assistant-based scheduling tools}

The previous section highlights that although there is a multitude of scheduling softwares available, they are not email-based intelligent virtual assistants (EIVA) and therefore lack the potential benefit that personalized AI technology could bring. Today, there are early products available in the market that have some features of an EIVA, like automatically responding to emails and recommending meeting times based on multiple calendars.

Microsoft's Cortana, though primarily a speech-based assistant targeted towards consumers, has calendaring and scheduling features as well. Cortana has built-in Office 365 capabilities, Microsoft's enterprise solution that includes integrated email accounts with calendars. Apart from being available on mobile devices, Cortana is also built into Windows 10, which has over 400 million users. Similarly, Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri also have scheduling features.

The leader in the AI-powered scheduling assistant industry is x.ai, a New York-based startup founded in 2014 that has raised over \$40 million in venture capital. Using the service, customers can select between Amy and Andrew, a female and male virtual assistant respectively. A major competitor to x.ai is Clara by Clara Labs, a similar virtual assistant for scheduling over email. Clara can also send email reminders to confirm attendance and find available conference rooms in an office.

In the Netherlands, a popular service called Datumprikker allows users to send meeting invitations, allowing guests to select their preferred times. Calendly, an Atlanta-based startup, currently leads this category, although their product is focused on one-on-one meetings as opposed to Datumprikker's preference for multiple guests.

There are also highly specialized solutions available. For example, in the travel space, Mezi uses a chatbot interface to ask the user questions, and can book their flights and hotels automatically and add them to the user's calendar. In the high-tech space, Google's Duplex uses advanced neural text-to-speech and speech recognition to place real phone calls to businesses to schedule appointments.

\subsection{Web development stack}

Why Vue.js, TypeScript, Node.js, etc.

\subsection{Author's previous work}

EIVA is the evolution of a project the author envisioned several years ago along with the client. In October 2017, the client (Speakup BV) organized a hackathon in Enschede, and the author participated with a colleague to build a concept of a disruptive communication technology. During the 24-hour period, we built ``Ara", a scheduling chatbot app which could message people from your team on your behalf to schedule meetings. We won two awards worth €500 each. Although Ara was only a prototype of an app-based assistant, it started a relationship with Florian Overkamp, the founder and chief entrepreneur of Speakup, and we decided to take the idea forward.

During the coming summer, I worked closely with Speakup on materializing Ara. For a period of two months, I expanded on the idea of scheduling assistants and decided to focus on email as the primary form factor. At the end of the project, I had a functional prototype of an assistant that could send appointment confirmation emails and used ``Wizard of Oz AI" to understand natural language, primarily based on a few ``if" conditions.

For a few months, I used Ara myself and tested the assistant's email confirmation feature. In fact, in a 2017 interview titled ``UT student among the top 50 young entrepreneurs" about my name in the Dutch business newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad's annual list of the 50 most-innovative entrepreneurs and professionals in the Netherlands with UToday, University of Twente's independent publication, Jelle Posthuma stated the following in the beginning of the article:

\begin{displayquote}
It was easy to schedule an interview with the first-year student of Creative Technology. His ``personal assistant" Ara sent a friendly email replying: ``You’ll be welcome to come next Wednesday." Chowdhary is a co-owner of the company Oswald Labs, which develops products for people with disabilities. His office is in Roombeek. ``Anand, you’re working hard: you even have a personal assistant…" A big grin appears on the young student’s face. ``Yes, I built her myself. Ara is a computer. Her AI recognizes emails and schedules my appointments."
\end{displayquote}

Although Ara didn't have any AI at this point, it was a successful proof-of-concept. The following summer, I worked again with Speakup, but primarily on building on top of an open-source SaaS framework that I had built over a few months (Staart API and Staart UI). This is the underlying framework that EIVA is built on top of. The budget also allowed me to spend some more time on exploring what a service-orientated implementation of Ara could look like.

During this Graduation Project, I decided to continue working with Speakup, and EIVA is a direct successor to Ara. However, the thesis presented the opportunity to take a research-driven approach, and no earlier code was reused, resulting in a new product built from the ground up with more sophisticated languages and frameworks.

\section{Specification}

This section will discuss the specifics on how the EIVA will be built.

\subsection{Tasks required in scheduling by an EIVA}

Since the majority of currently available scheduling tools are not assistant-based, most users prefer to use email for scheduling rather than currently available specialized software. A survey of workers in the field of information management found that over 80\% of the respondents use email for scheduling and organization \cite{ducheneaut_e-mail_2001}.

The process of scheduling online appointments is non-trivial and requires several rounds of communication, coordination, and negotiation.

\subsubsection{Understanding natural language over email}

Communication with devices using natural language is commonplace for many people today, especially with the advent of affordable smart voice assistants, such as Alexa, available on Amazon Echo; and Google Assistant, available on Google Home \cite{de_barcelos_silva_intelligent_2020}. Their interface, which translates a human's intention into a device's control commands using speech recognition and natural language interpretation, is known as a Natural Language Interface (NLI). The dialogue-style nature of the interactions between the user and the device and their ability to preserve context across different queries are benefits of using NLIs over other user interfaces \cite{kiseleva_predicting_2016}.

Personification of the scheduling process using natural language has the additional benefit of increased likeliness of error forgiveness by end users. In a study, over 80\% of the participants who encountered errors in NLIs understanding them said that either their attitude was unaffected or the users themselves ``must have typed in something wrong" \cite{kelley_iterative_1984}. Furthermore, NLIs allow people to use their existing calendaring tools and idiosyncrasies by adopting email as the user interface and natural language conversations as the interaction mode. For example, a message such as ``Please schedule an appointment with Florian for next week" should be enough for the EIVA to take over the remainder of the process.

\subsubsection{Parameter recommendations}

Recommendation systems are frequently used in several industries to help users make better decisions. Examples of collaborative recommender systems include product recommendations on e-commerce website Amazon \cite{linden_amazoncom_2003} and TV series recommendations on the streaming provider Netflix \cite{gomez-uribe_netflix_2016}. Modern systems may use various machine learning techniques like artificial neural networks combined with feature extraction methods to find the ideal recommendation \cite{adomavicius_toward_2005}.

Scheduling a single appointment requires agreement on several parameters, such as date, time, duration, and location of meeting. Recommending a set of these parameters must be based on the user's predetermined preferences, such as the hours they prefer for scheduling calls. However, the ideal implementation of such a recommendation system may take a multidimensional approach that uses additional contextual information \cite{adomavicius_incorporating_2005}. For example, contextual information may include the user's location to account for the travel time to a recommended meeting's location; or, for international calls, it may include the guest's timezone based on their IP address.

\subsubsection{Negotiation}

Since not all guests may be available at the initially proposed time, the next major task required by the EIVA is negotiation. The negotiation mechanism allows it to be flexible about constraints imposed by the preferences of other users. Zunino and Campo (2009) note that the negotiation mechanism ``starts when two [users] do not agree on some parameter of a meeting," such as the date, time, or location of the meeting \cite{zunino_chronos_2009}. Then, the guest may propose a new set of parameters for the meeting, for example by modifying its time. The EIVA will evaluate whether the proposal is convenient or not by comparing the ``likeliness of reaching a consensus using the previous meeting parameters with the proposed parameters." In this step, it can also make a judgement call by choosing to ignore part of the user's preferred parameters in order to agree with the guests. This back-and-forth negotiation process needs to occur asynchronously, ``sometimes requiring several days for the parties to reach consensus" \cite{cranshaw_calendarhelp_2017}.

\subsubsection{Renegotiation and confirmation invitations}

In the dynamic environment that is the modern workplace, changing appointment parameters is commonplace. A study found that 66\% of all scheduled meetings by a CEO underwent a parameter change \cite{dennis_how_2018}. Inevitably, once a meeting is scheduled, it requires ``continuous maintenance, as new events often prompt meeting updates and reschedules" \cite{cranshaw_calendarhelp_2017}. To finalize the meeting parameters, the EIVA should take into account the parameter preferences of both the user and all guests.

To make sure that all guests have the most recent parameters, confirmations and reminders may be sent by the EIVA. However, not all users use the same calendaring software, with some professionals using no digital calendar at all. Kincaid (1985) reported that approximately one half of all meetings scheduled by professionals were with users using a different calendaring system than their own \cite{kincaid_electronic_1985}. Therefore, the EIVA will be required to send these emails using industry standards supported by most software. The primary standard to store and exchange calendaring and scheduling information is the Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar) \cite{desruisseaux_internet_2009}.

\section{Realization}

\subsection{Product Development}

A simplified version of the Software Development Life Cycle and the New Product Development Process were adopted for this project, with the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Idea
	\item Research
	\item Development
	\item External testing
	\item Analysis
\end{enumerate}

The first step (Idea) builds on top of the ideation phase with methodological exploration of the idea and specifying the required feature as a module. In the second step (Research), the technical literature research present in ``State of the Art" is studied to architect the module's technology. In the third step (Development), the idea is materialized by writing code and testing the module by writing unit tests and conducting end-to-end tests with the platform. In the fourth step (External testing), a test is conducted with the client or research participants. In the last step (Analysis), the feedback from the test is evaluated for the next cycle.

  \captionof{figure}{The New Product Development Process}
  \label{fig:test2}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Cycle 1}

The first cycle was internal with both the initial development and several refactors. This was the only cycle that did not undergo an external test.

\paragraph{Assistant Email Address}

One of the specification conditions was to ensure unique email addresses for each organization using the assistant service, because teams may have similar names of assistants. For example, the default name of the assistant, ``Ara Isaacson", may generate the email address ``ara@araassistant.com", which does not share any information about who the assistant works for. Since unique email addresses for each team is mandatory, the team's slug was incorporated in the address, i.e., ``username@araassistant.com", for example ``florian@araassistant.com". This has two advantages: firstly, it tells the guests receiving emails from the assistant who the true host is; and secondly, the email receiving architecture can relate the unique email address to the owner's details.

However, in the first cycle itself, the assistant's default email was changed from ``username@domain" to ``meet-username@domain" where ``username" is the organization slug and the domain is the assistant's service domain. This was done to prevent confusion based on the email address; for example, ``florian@araassistant.com" may be mistaken as the email address of Florian himself (the user), whereas ``meet-florian@araassistant.com" implies that the email address is of the assistant, using which you can schedule an appointment with Florian.

\subsubsection{Cycle 2}

Privacy features, privacy onboarding

\subsubsection{Cycle 3}

Support for non-Google Calendar with iCal

\subsubsection{Cycle 4}

NLP in multiple languages rather than translation \thesubsubsection

\subsubsection{Cycle 5}

Slack, email from Florian

\subsubsection{Cycle 6}

External feedback from Rohit, Maurits, Alex

\subsection{Open Source Development}

Although the preceding project Ara was licensed under the open source permissive MIT license, EIVA's source code is made available under the Server Side Public License. This license makes sure that any further implementations or paid services built around EIVA also have their source code made public, and helps the future business use case of EIVA.

However, several open source projects were built in order to support key EIVA features, which were all licensed under the MIT license. This encourages wide community adoption and contributes back to the open source ecosystem, as MIT is the most popular open source license and allows commercial usage of open source projects.

For example, the open source project ``calendar-link" was built in order to generate event links to popular calendar services like Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and Yahoo! Calendar. This project is now used by many others, receiving over 1,000 downloads every week and contributed to by 5 additional developers. Developers can use the package to programmatically generate that users can click on to add a specific event to their calendar, with an easy-to-use API:

...

Similarly, another project ``calendar-slots" was released to help find available slots in a user's calendar. This package can save development times when recommending appointment slots by listing a user's calendars, fetching all events in a given timeframe, removing slots with conflicts with scheduled events, and recommending a fixed number of slots to the end user:

...

It is also highly configurable, with support for settings such as timezone preference, daily scheduling hours, and custom filter options:

...

Both projects are written in TypeScript and available on the Git hosting service GitHub and JavaScript package registry NPM.

\subsubsection{Server Monitoring}

\paragraph{Uptime Monitoring}

Although measures have been taken to make sure EIVA services don't go down, such as installing Cloudflare' Always Online which serves a static version of a webpage if it is not available from the origin server [], there is sometimes nothing one can do to prevent a website from going down. ``Traffic spikes, malware attacks, data center problems, etc." can cause server downtime [].

To monitor the uptime of the services and get real-time notifications in case of downtime, \emph{Uptime Robot} is installed []. In intervals of 5 minutes, Uptime Robot makes network requests to the frontend and backend URLs, logs the response time (Figure), and sends an email and Slack notification in case any URL is unavailable.

Over the course of testing weeks, no downtime was recorded for the backend, but the frontend was unavailable twice for a period of 2 minutes and 57 seconds and 2 minutes and 44 seconds on June 7 and June 9 2020 respectively. This was due of a Netlify deploying error because of renamed respositories. Both times, this error was immediately fixed because of the real-time notifications feature, and resulted in a $>$ 99.9\% overall uptime.

\paragraph{Resource Monitoring}

\emph{Netdata} is used.

\paragraph{Event Tracking}

\emph{ElasticSearch} is used. Open Distro for ElasticSearch is used for increased security, including data encryption at rest and Kibana authentication.

As an example, the average number of events tracked per day in the first week of June 2020 was 1,062.4 (Figure 4).

    };
    
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Number of events tracked in June 1–7 2020}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Catching Errors}

To catch errors in production, \emph{Sentry} is deployed in both the frontend and backend applications. Sentry is an open source error tracking system [Sentry.io] that automatically reports errors as soon as they occur. ``In addition to sending developers alerts, Sentry also gives them context for potential root cause analysis to help them identify the source of the error" [Techcrunch].

Although the backend project collects server logs, they are frequently intentional debugging information. Logging provides a trail of events, but Sentry only focuses on exceptions, i.e., catching application crashes or HTTP request errors. Furthermore, Sentry helps list a trail of usage events like mouse clicks and network requests to discover the context of an error [Sentry.io Logging].

Licensed under Apache 2, Sentry is open source but offers a hosted service with a generous free plan, which is used for this project. The @sentry/browser package is used to track errors originating in client-side web applications running in browsers, and @sentry/node is used for the Node.js package.

Over the course of testing weeks, 3 errors were tracked for the frontend project, but no errors were found in the backend project.

\subsection{User Experience Research}

After building and deploying a functional virtual agent and its companion web application, a user experience research is conducted with participants with diverse backgrounds. The user experience research is completely virtual and divided in three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introductory Survey
	\item Assistant Usage
	\item User Experience Evaluation
\end{enumerate}

The questions are specifically written in a first-person form, as the assistant also interacts, and additional information has been included when asking for potentially personal details. Options in multiple choice questions are randomized to eliminate order bias.

\subsubsection{Introductory Survey}

After reading the Information Brochure (Appendix 1.1) signing the Consent Form (Appendix 1.2), participants answer 16 questions about their prior experience with scheduling appointments, email usage, and personal assistants. This information helps with understanding how users currently set appointments, and with setting the default values for settings (Section 6.2).

Appendix 1.3 lists all the options for each question. The Introductory Survey is divided into two parts; the first part is focuses on scheduling preferences and email usage:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Which type of profession best describes you? This helps us relate scheduling experience with types of work.
	\item Say you had to schedule an appointment with a colleague (if you're a professional) or a professor (if you're a student). How would you do it?
	\item How frequently do you check your email, on average, on working days?
	\item What languages do you send emails in? Enter as many as you like.
	\item Do you have email notifications enabled on your phone?
	\item What service do you use for your primary email account?
	\item What do you use email for? Select as many as you like.
	\item What calendar service do you use, if any? Select as many as you like.
\end{enumerate}

The second part asks participants about using personal assistants for scheduling:

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item If you had a personal assistant, would you ask them to schedule your appointments for you?
	\item Imagine that you had an AI-powered, virtual personal assistant who could set up appointments for you by finding available times in your calendar and sending emails on your behalf. Would you use this service?
	\item Say that you ask your virtual assistant to schedule an appointment with someone. For the recipient, this email would be indistinguishable from an email sent by a human assistant. Should the virtual assistant inform the recipient that it is not a human, but an AI-powered virtual assistant?
	\item Should recipients be able to unsubscribe from your assistant's emails, i.e., "opt out" of talking to an AI, and choose to only communicate with you instead?
	\item Would you like to know whether or not someone has seen an email sent by the assistant?
	\item If you have enabled email tracking, should end users know that a read receipt has been shared, i.e., a notice at the end of the email, "The sender has been notified that you've opened this email"?
	\item Apart from scheduling appointments, what else would you like your virtual assistant to do, over email?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Assistant Usage}

After finishing the Introductory Survey, participants start using the assistant service with the help of virtual guides consisting of several screenshots, an onboarding wizard, and an introductory tour.

The participants open the web application on \url{https://myeiva.com} and create an account. After creating their account, the verify their email and log into their accounts. They then complete the onboarding flow, setting up basic information such as their name, timezone, gender, security preferences, and name of their assistant.

Then, they follow an introductory tour which helps them customize their assistant's settings, add additional meeting locations, etc., before sending an email to their assistants. After sending an email to schedule an appointments, participants go back to the survey for the UX evaluation.

\subsubsection{User Experience Evaluation}

In the last part, participants answer questions about the experience of both the assistant and the web application in the form of another survey:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What comes to mind when you think about EIVA (how would you describe it to a friend)?
	\item On a scale from 1 to 5, review the following about the web app. 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Overall experience of the web app (not the assistant)
		\item Design of the web app
		\item Functionality of the web app
		\item Ease of use of the web app
		\item Privacy features available in the web app
		\item Overall experience of the onboarding flow
		\item Overall experience of the introductory tour
	\end{enumerate}
	\item On a scale from 1 to 5, review the following about the assistant. 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Overall experience of the assistant over email
		\item Customizability of the assistant
		\item Flexibility in understanding natural language
		\item How human-like does the assistant sound over email? 1 is not human-like at all and 5 is indistinguishable from a human.
		\item How much do you trust the assistant to not make mistakes? 1 is the least trust and 5 is the most.
		\item How accurate, practical, and logical were the time recommendations made by the assistant?
	\end{enumerate}
	\item How many emails did you sent with the assistant in CC?
	\item Did the assistant understand your email(s) correctly?
	\item Did the assistant respond to your email in a reasonable amount of time?
	\item Did the assistant recommend the correct location for the appointment?
	\item Did the assistant meet your expectations in terms of scheduling an appointment?
	\item Which of these features of the web app did you use?
	\item If you were the recipient of an email from EIVA, would you be able to tell whether it's an email from an AI or human assistant, if you didn't know?
	\item If we launch EIVA as a service where users can get their own assistants, will you use it?
	\item Based on the amount of time EIVA saves when setting appointments, how much would you be willing to pay for such a service?
	\item Did you find anything frustrating that you wish was easier or different?
	\item Is there anything that you wish the assistant could do, in terms of scheduling, that it doesn't currently?
	\item What do you like the most about EIVA?
	\item What do you like the least about EIVA?
	\item Do you have any additional feedback, suggestions, or comments?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Evaluation}

This section will discuss the results of UX research, what features people like, their privacy preferences, ease of use, analytics from the app, etc.

\subsection{Introductory Survey}

A diverse group of users participated in the survey, both working professionals and students. 4 out of 10 respondents were employed full-time by a company or organization, another 4 were students, and 2 out of 10 were freelancers or self-employed individuals (Table 1).

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
   	 \caption{Professions of Participants}
      \centering
        \begin{tabular}{lr}
	        \hline
            \textbf{Profession} & \textbf{Percentage} \\
            \hline
            Employed & 40\% \\
            Student & 40\% \\
            Self-employed & 20\% \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}%
    \hspace{.1cm}
    \begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
      \centering
	    \caption{Preferred Modes of Scheduling}
        \begin{tabular}{lr}
	        \hline
            \textbf{Mode} & \textbf{Percentage} \\
            \hline
            Send an email & 70\% \\
            Work chat message & 40\% \\
            Consumer chat & 40\% \\
            Phone call & 30\% \\
            Go to office or desk & 10\% \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage} 
\end{table}

In Table 2, `Work chat' refers to instant messaging services like Slack and Microsoft Teams whereas `Consumer chat' refers to services like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, and participants could choose multiple options. The results show a preference for emails, as noted in State of the Art (Section 2). Apart from email, chat services are popular with users too, whereas physically reaching out is the least often used.

\subsubsection{Email and Calendar Usage}

To identity whether email is the ideal use case, participants were asked about their frequency of checking their email (Table 4) and sending emails (Table 3).

Most participants (80\%) check their email multiple times per day, whereas only 1 in 10 users check their email at least once per day or week. 5 out of 10 participants send one or more emails every day, where 4 in 10 and 1 in 10 participants send new emails every day or week respectively.

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
   	 \caption{Frequency of Emails Sent}
      \centering
        \begin{tabular}{lr}
	        \hline
            \textbf{Number of Emails} & \textbf{Percentage} \\
            \hline
            One or more per day & 50\% \\
            One every few days & 40\% \\
            One every few weeks & 10\% \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}%
    \hspace{.1cm}
    \begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
      \centering
	    \caption{Frequency of Checking Email}
        \begin{tabular}{lr}
	        \hline
            \textbf{Number of Times} & \textbf{Percentage} \\
            \hline
            Multiple times per day & 80\% \\
            At least once per day & 10\% \\
            At least once per week & 10\% \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage} 
\end{table}

Since EIVA supports both English and Dutch, participants were asked their preferred languages for email communication. All participants selected English, 3 in 10 participants also chose Dutch, and 1 participant also selected Polish.

For better integration with large email providers, participants were also asked about their primary email service provider. Half of all participants use Google's Gmail or G Suite, 2 in 10 use a Microsoft service (like Hotmail or Live), and 1 in 10 use each of Yahoo!, custom hosted SMTP, or others.

Furthermore, they were asked whether they have email notifications enabled on their smartphones, to which all participants responded in the affirmative.

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
   	 \caption{Email Languages}
      \centering
        \begin{tabular}{lr}

            \hline
            English & 100\% \\
            Dutch & 30\% \\
            Polish & 10\% \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}%
    \hspace{.1cm}
    \begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
      \centering
	    \caption{Email Service Providers}
        \begin{tabular}{lr}
	        \hline
            \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Percentage} \\
            \hline
            Google & 50\% \\
            Microsoft & 20\% \\
            Yahoo! & 10\% \\
            SMTP & 10\% \\
            Other & 10\% \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage} 
\end{table}

Apart from scheduling, there are also several other reasons to use email. Participants were asked \emph{What do you use email for?}, and all participants selected work-related communication. 7 in 10 also chose scheduling appointments, while 3 in 10 use email to connect with friends and family. 2 out of 10 participants use email for outbound marketing, whereas 1 in 10 also use it for customer support.

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \begin{minipage}{1\linewidth}
   	 \caption{Reasons for Sending Emails}
      \centering
        \begin{tabular}{lr}
	        \hline
            \textbf{Reason} & \textbf{Percentage} \\
            \hline
            Other work-related communication & 100\% \\
            Scheduling appointments & 70\% \\
            Connecting with friends and family & 30\% \\
            Sending marketing emails or newsletters & 20\% \\
            Contacting customer support & 10\% \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}%
\end{table}

Although EIVA connects with any calendar application that follows the iCalendar standard, which all major services do, it also directly integrates with Google Calendar. This was chosen with the hypothesis that it's the most popular calendar service, which was proved to be true based on the participants' responses. Half of all participants selected Google Calendar as their primary calendar service, 4 out of 10 participants use Microsoft Outlook, and another 20\% each use Apple Calendar or no calendar. Lastly, 1 in 10 respondents use a custom, self-hosted calendar.

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \begin{minipage}{1\linewidth}
   	 \caption{Primary Calendar Services}
      \centering
        \begin{tabular}{lr}

            \textbf{Reason} & \textbf{Percentage} \\
            \hline
            Google Calendar & 50\% \\
            Microsoft Outlook & 40\% \\
            Apple Calendar & 20\% \\
            \emph{I don't use a calendar app} & 20\% \\
            Self-hosted calendar & 10\% \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}%
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Personal Assistant for Scheduling}

In the second part of the Introductory Survey, participants were asked hypotheticals about using an assistant for scheduling meetings. The results of the six polar questions (yes/no) are tabulated in Table 9.

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \begin{minipage}{1\linewidth}
   	 \caption{Responses to Polar Question}
      \centering
        \begin{tabular}{p{10cm}p{2cm}}
	        \hline
            \textbf{Question} & \textbf{Percentage of `Yes'} \\
            \hline
            If you had a personal assistant, would you ask them to schedule your appointments for you? & 90\% \\
            Would you use the EIVA service? & 80\% \\
            Should EIVA inform recipients that it is not human? & 60\% \\
            Should recipients be able to unsubscribe from EIVA emails? & 60\% \\
            Would you like to know whether someone has seen an email sent by EIVA? & 40\% \\
            If you have enabled email tracking, should recipients know that a read receipt has been shared? & 70\% \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}%
\end{table}

Currently, EIVA only sets appointments but the big picture goal of EIVA is to automate several other workflows, like automatically responding to emails or sending outbound marketing emails. Participants were also asked what other features they would like to see.

Table 10 summarizes the most-requested additional features that participants want EIVA to have. 9 out of 10 respondents requested reminders, 7 out 10 selected automatic frequent email responses, and 6 out of 10 selected email follow-ups to team members. 2 out of 10 participants requested sending marketing emails, and 1 out of 10 self-requested emails with their schedule for the day.

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \begin{minipage}{1\linewidth}
   	 \caption{Most Requested Additional Features}
      \centering
        \begin{tabular}{lr}
	        \hline
            \textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Percentage} \\
            \hline
            Reminders & 90\% \\
            Auto-respond to frequent emails & 70\% \\
            Send email follow-ups & 60\% \\
            Send marketing emails & 20\% \\
            Daily schedule summary email & 10\% \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}%
\end{table}

\subsection{User Experience Evaluation}

The first question, \emph{What comes to mind when you think about EIVA; how would you describe it to a friend?}, allows users to share their first impressions after using the service. Some of the responses were:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item ``A smart interface to my calendar"
	\item ``A way to avoid having to talk to people to schedule your appointments with them"
	\item ``Make my appointment very easy, Easy to see all meetings in one screen! Awesome Product!"
	\item ``Interesting personal automation, severely limited at the moment"
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Webapp Experience}

Users were asked to rate the web app on different parameters, from 0 to 5. All parameters scored over 4 out of 5, with privacy features rated with the highest average of 4.9.

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \begin{minipage}{1\linewidth}
   	 \caption{Webapp Experience Ratings}

            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}%
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Assistant Experience}

Similarly, users were asked to rate the assistant on different parameters, from 0 to 5.

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \begin{minipage}{1\linewidth}
   	 \caption{Assistant Experience Ratings}
      \centering
        \begin{tabular}{llcc}

            \hline
            Overall experience & \score{4.6}{5} 4.6 & 5 & 5 \\
            Customizability & \score{4.4}{5} 4.4 & 4 & 5 \\
            Natural language understanding flexibility & \score{4.4}{5} 4.4 & 4 & 5 \\
            Sounding human-like over email & \score{4.3}{5} 4.3 & 4 & 4 \\
            Trust & \score{3.7}{5} 3.7 & 4 & 4 \\
            Time recommendations & \score{2.7}{5} 2.7 & 3 & 3 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}%
\end{table}

To participate in the research, users were required to send at least one email to the EIVA for scheduling an appointment. They were free to send multiple emails, and were asked about the number of emails they sent. 4 out of 10 participants sent only one email, while 6 out of 10 sent between 2 and 5 emails.

To find out whether the assistant understood the overall meaning of their email in natural language, participants were asked \emph{Did the assistant understand your email(s) correctly?}. 7 out of 10 participants responded in the affirmative, while 3 out of 10 responded with `Partially'. No participants responded in the negative, suggesting that the EIVA did a well-enough job understanding incoming emails.

            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage} 
\end{table}

Apart from understanding the meaning of an email, participants were asked whether the EIVA recommended the correct location for the meeting. The location recommendation was correct for 7 out of 10 participants.

They were also directly asked whether the EIVA met their expectation in terms of scheduling an appointment. All participants responded positively.

    \end{minipage} 
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Business Case}

Since the big picture goal of the client is to launch EIVA as a paid service, participants were asked whether they would use EIVA on launch. 8 out of 10 participants said that they would, whereas 2 out of 10 wouldn't.

Participants were also asked how much they would be willing to pay every month for such as service. 4 out of 10 participants said that the service should be free, 3 out of 10 would each pay €5 or less, or €10 or less, per month. No participants wanted to pay €20 per month.

\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Business Case}

In the literature research for this paper, it is highlighted that professionals currently either schedule appointments themselves or hire assistants to help with the task. However, regardless of whether the professional or their assistant schedules appointments, the time wasted is not insignificant. According to the European Commission, the average Dutch small or medium-sized enterprise (SME) employs 3.2 people \cite{noauthor_2019_2019}. If each employee attends 7 meetings per week (which is the average for professionals), 26 otherwise productive hours are wasted every month in scheduling meetings \cite{kincaid_electronic_1985}. This costs the company over €450 in lost time, based on the average wage of €17.6 per hour \cite{noauthor_salary_nodate} This adds up to almost €2.25 billion per year for the SME industry as a whole, and the numbers are even higher for larger enterprises. University of Twente, for example, employs 3,150 professionals, adding up to over €400,000 in lost time per year.

Therefore, a strong business case can be built around launching EIVA as a service. Since the assistant can save around €150 in lost time per month for professionals, a service that costs as high as €100 per month per person has a return on investment (ROI) of 50\%. In my personal opinion, a pricing point of less than €50 per month can be achieved because of the low cloud infrastructure costs. The proposed pricing plans are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Basic plan for €10 per month, targeted towards students, self-employed young professionals, and early-stage entrepreneurs with no support for custom domain, but including unlimited scheduling and assistant usage
	\item Pro plan for €25 per month with support for custom domain
	\item Team plan for €30 per user per month, targeted towards businesses or institutions who want to onboard their entire team to EIVA for a collaborative experience
	\item Custom plan with custom billing for large enterprises with features like dedicated support, on-premise hosting, and uptime service-level agreements (SLA)
\end{enumerate}
